# Logo Files

## No Logos Required

The application does not require any logo files. The welcome page displays only the title and content without logos.

If you need to add logos in the future, you can:
1. Place logo files in this directory
2. Update the welcome component to display them
3. See `LOGO_SPECIFICATIONS.md` for format requirements (if needed)
